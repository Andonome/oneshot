This is a one-shot adventure for the [BIND RPG][core].

## Plot

The PCs have been captured by goblins.
`Goblins' here are gnomes twisted by evil magic into nura.
Soon, the players will be misshapen too, turned into ogres in order to bolster the army so they can destroy everything nearby.

They awaken in a cell with nothing but their clothes, and must find a way to escape the chaos.

## Aims

The adventure is a PC meat-grinder, with plenty of prisons scattered through the dungeon for players to return with new characters once they die.
As they travel upwards towards the sunlight, they learn about the rules and the wider world of Fenestra.
