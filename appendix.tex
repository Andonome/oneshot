      There is something I seek.

      While it is bound, it chooses kings and peasants.
      When it is freed, it foretells war or woe.

      While it bound, it propels men's lusts and furies.
      When it is freed, it tumbles, falls, and fades.

      While it is bound, life will often thrive.
      When it is freed, death will often follow.

    I can crush great boulders into fine sand,

    I'm dry at night, but wet in day

    I tend to stop where I can't stay

    My speed goes up as I slow down

    I wear naught but a silver crown

    I don't rely, I don't depend

    But cannot grow without a friend

    I can't stand rain, but need the sky

    So I ask you: what am I?
