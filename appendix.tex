\noindent
The Lift, unlike so many \glspl{artefact}, began as \pgls{spell}.
The gnomes imbued it with sentience, and managed to teach it enough about \gls{casting} to let it store \glsentrylongpl{mp}, and regenerate itself.

It can lift a total \gls{weight} of 256 before spending \pgls{mp} to revitalize.
If it ever spends all \glspl{mp}, it dies.

      There is something I seek.

      When it is freed, it tumbles, falls, and fades.

      While it is bound, life will often thrive.
      When it is freed, death will often follow.
