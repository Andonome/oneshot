\chapter{Riddles}

The rules for riddles are simple -- any question which someone has the knowledge to answer is a fair riddle.
Asking `how many letters in the Greek word for ``mushroom''?', is not a fair riddle, because someone may not know.

Any possible answer to a riddle is `the correct one'.
If someone asks `what is black and white and read all over', anything which fits all descriptions must be accepted as an answer.
