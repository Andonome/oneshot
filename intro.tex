  \subsection*{Context}

  This is an introduction module for \gls{bind}.

  You have:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    An overview of \glsfmttext{fenestra} \vpageref{fenestraGlosPreamble}.
    \item
    Rules for running the module \vpagerefrange{glosPreamble}{rulesEnd}.
    \item
    Pre-generated characters at the back.
  \end{itemize}

  You will need:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    A sharp blade to slice the character sheets and rules booklet from the back.
    \item
    Floss and a needle to bind the miniature rules booklet.%
    \item
    Pencils and dice for each player.
  \end{itemize}
}

Slice out the miniature rulebook at the back and fold it along the dark lines until it looks like a book, then put two stitches in the spine.
Finally, take the blade, and cut the pages open.
