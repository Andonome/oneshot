\noindent
The PCs awaken to find themselves in prison, deep underground.
Their last memories of being taken from their home villages by goblins surface slowly.

Over the course of the adventure, they find out that the gnomes opened a portal to an astral plane where the nura seeped in.
Once inside, the nura transformed the gnomes into more nura.
These little nura are known as `goblins'.

Transforming into a nura creature makes one tall, strong, fast, and incredibly stupid and hungry.
Deeply hungry, all the time.

When humans become nura, they become tall and fast.
People know them as `ogres', but the basic idea remains the same.
For more on nura and how they act, see \textit{Adventures in Fenestra}.

Once out into the dungeon, they may speak to a dragon who guards a hidden passage, grab magical scrolls made by the gnomes before they became so deformed, and avoid the traps, guards, and aberrations of the dungeon.
They will meet other prisoners, and hear how the nura destroyed all the villages around, taking people back as captives to be eaten or turned into ogres.
Finally, they will hear that the local town lies under siege to a growing nura horde.

\section{Oneshot Rules}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\subsection{Creation}

Players should start the adventure first, and make characters second.
They will awaken in a dark room, and slowly pull together their identity while introducing themselves to each other.

The PCs will need to spend Story Points to navigate this dungeon, so remind them that they each have 5 Story Points which can be used to declare that they know a language, that they have known another PC, or to find a friend with some specialized skill.

Since this short adventure has little opportunity for growing skills, PCs should start with 70 XP.

Alongside the characters, James rests in the corner.
He exists to explain that there were more prisoners, and the nura took them all away.

\subsection{Death}

If any character dies, another can be introduced in any of the prisons.
The nura regularly send out raiding parties to capture people, and those people get dumped back into the prisons, so even if the PCs have fled the prisons, any time they return, more prisoners can be found and liberated.

Returning characters should start with the same XP total they have accumulated, rather than the usual, lower totals.
If a player earns 10 XP during the mission and then dies, they return with 80 XP.
