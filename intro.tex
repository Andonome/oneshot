  \subsection*{Context}

  This book stands alone, with complete rules attached.
  It only demands that you print it, and the handouts.

  For more detailed rules, BIND uses a triad of books:
  \begin{description}
    \item[The Stories Book]
    shows players how to craft new characters, and detail the backstory, by spending \glspl{storypoint}.
    \item[Judgement]
    guides the \glsentrytext{gm} in crafting their own little patch of this world -- \glsentrytext{fenestra}, and explains the inhabitants, plants, and strange weather conditions.
    \item[The Core Book]
    serves as a reference for tried-and-tested rulings, along with lists of spells, Knacks, et~c.
  \end{description}
}
