\sidequest[Town,Roads,Forest]{\Glsfmttext{warren}}
\label{gnomeWarrenPrelude}

\noindent
When the gnomes of the \gls{warren} find alchemical plant-\glspl{ingredient} in the \gls{deep}, they don't ask if anyone owns them -- they just start making \glspl{talisman}!
The \glspl{pc} encounter groups of gnomes selling their wares a few times before trouble strikes.
In a flash, the goblins who owned those powerful plants, which grow in the \gls{deep}, follow the gnomes and slay them.
But once trapped in the \gls{warren}, they realize they will soon starve.
They cannot speak the \gls{tradeTongue}, and cannot barter for food, which leaves only one option; they must devour the local \glspl{village}.

If the \glspl{pc} manage to fend off the horde's raiding party, the next session begins with terrible news: another raiding party has captured their allies (or someone form the \glspl{pc}'s \gls{characterPool}).
The \glspl{pc} will have to descend into the warren to rescue their loved ones.

If, on the other hand, the \glspl{pc} are defeated by the raiding party, they will find the \glspl{ogre} do not kill them, but prefer to grab them and stuff them into sacks.
In this case, they begin in the \textit{bowels} of the \gls{warren}, without their weapons, and must fight their way out.

\sqpart{Roads}% AREA
{Timid Sales-People}% NAME
{Gnomes quietly watch the \glsfmtplural{pc}, hoping to sell \Glsfmtplural{ingredient}}% SUMMARY

\begin{exampletext}
		Yan, Lawa, and a few other gnomes have five (yes, five!) alchemical \glspl{ingredient} encased in two phials of fungal-oil.
		The first phial has two green-leaved plants, usable as Earth \glspl{ingredient}, and the second has three red-leaved plant, useable as Fire \glspl{ingredient}.
		They want to sell these phials at rock-bottom prices, and scamper back to the \gls{warren}.

		Unfortunately, the gnomes don't know if the \glspl{pc} will try to kill them, and simply take the \glspl{ingredient}.
		They listen to the \glspl{pc} for a while to gauge their character, before negotiationing.

\end{exampletext}


\begin{boxtext}
	A harsh wind rattles the \gls{bothy}'s door and makes the forest shake.
	Taking a look outside, you find the peephole completely black -- the night doesn't show even the feintest hint of moonlight.

	What do you all talk about before sleep?
\end{boxtext}

If the \glspl{pc} rest in \pgls{bothy}, a gnome listens by pushing her ear up to the peephole, which blocks it entirely.
Or if the \glspl{pc} have a camp by the roadside, the gnomes will listen nearby while Lawa casts a Fire spell to warm the them, so they don't need to light their own fire (which would alert the \glspl{pc}).

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} sound like ruffians,}
the gnomes leave, quietly.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} sound like alright people,}
Yan approaches and introduces himself with a friendly wave, or a knock on their \gls{bothy} door and begins bartering (though he does not carry the \glspl{ingredient}).

\paragraph{While bartering,}
Yan will not let the \glspl{pc} inspect the goods; instead he says that they should simply tell him the prices they \textit{would pay} (assuming the \glspl{ingredient} check out), and that he will then take one phial at a time, then take payment.

The gnomes will sell the phial with two Earth \glspl{ingredient} for 12~\glspl{sp}, and the second phial, with three Fire \glspl{ingredient} for 15~\glspl{sp}.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} inspect the goods,}
they cannot identify the plants without an \roll{Intelligence}{Xenomology} roll (\tn[12]).
They also cannot barter for individual \glspl{ingredient} -- they can only buy phials.

Each phial has \pgls{weight} of 1.

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{\squash~Flooding the Market}% NAME
{The price of \Glsfmtplural{ingredient} has plummeted as gnomes sell for cheap}% SUMMARY

\begin{exampletext}
  As gnomes from the \gls{warren} have been selling cheap \glspl{ingredient}, everyone in town has an opinion.
  Everyone at the \gls{templeOfFrost} loves it, as they can buy cheaply, while any \glspl{guard} in town speak bitterly about the lower prices, as they can't sell the bodies of \glspl{monster} for the usual high prices.
\end{exampletext}

Earth, Fire, and Water \glspl{ingredient} have been sold for around 7~\glspl{sp} each, but people sell them for 14~\glspl{sp} (`\textit{low prices can't last forever!}').
Each \gls{ingredient} is a phial, encased in fungal oil to preserve it, and has \pgls{weight} of 1.

\sqpart{Forest}% AREA
{\squash~Gnomes to the Rescue}% NAME
{\Glsentrytext{kalama} helps out the \glspl{pc} with his \glsfmtplural{talisman}, then wants paid}% SUMMARY

En route to town (to sell \glspl{ingredient}) this band of gnomes run into the \glspl{pc} (at the same time as the next \gls{segment}).
The gnomes immediately hide at the roadside (as gnomes usually do).

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} seem friendly,}
they may try to sell their goods for 5~\glspl{sp} per \glspl{ingredient}.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} have run into trouble,}
the gnomes will help, but will also ask for reimbursement: 10~\glspl{sp} for each \glspl{talisman} used.
If the \glspl{pc} cannot pay, they ask them to pay later, and begin drawing up a contract.
The gnomes then begin arguing loudly about whether or not humans are capable of writing.
