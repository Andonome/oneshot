\sidequest[Town,Roads,Forest]{\Glsfmttext{warren}}
\label{gnomeWarrenPrelude}

\noindent
When the gnomes of the \gls{warren} find alchemical plant-\glspl{ingredient} in the \gls{deep}, they don't ask if anyone owns them -- they just start making \glspl{talisman}!
The \glspl{pc} encounter groups of gnomes selling their wares a few times before trouble strikes.
In a flash, the goblins who owned those powerful plants, which grow in the \gls{deep}, follow the gnomes and slay them.
But once trapped in the \gls{warren}, they realize they will soon starve.
They cannot speak the \gls{tradeTongue}, and cannot barter for food, which leaves only one option; they must devour the local \glspl{village}.

If the \glspl{pc} manage to fend off the horde's raiding party, the next session begins with terrible news: another raiding party has captured their allies (or someone form the \glspl{pc}'s \gls{characterPool}).
The \glspl{pc} will have to descend into the warren to rescue their loved ones.

If, on the other hand, the \glspl{pc} are defeated by the raiding party, they will find the \glspl{ogre} do not kill them, but prefer to grab them and stuff them into sacks.
In this case, they begin in the \textit{bowels} of the \gls{warren}, without their weapons, and must fight their way out.
