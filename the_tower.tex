\chapter{The Black Tower}
\epigraph{
  Emerging into the wild hills, you see the Sun beginning its descent.
  Clouds gather overhead.
  A nasty roaring sound comes from someone's stomach.

  The hill ridges all around lie empty, with a cold wind.
  Below, the forest offers food, darkness, and danger.

  Where do you go?
}{}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\noindent
The party probably thought they were out of the woods, but you can continue the adventure with the black tower.
This lonely island of civilization provides the only place to rest and eat.

\begin{exampletext}
  The black tower began as a half-way house for the \gls{guard}, as they travelled between Darton and Grungefell.
  The wardens of Grungefell never posted enough guards, spending the town's money on games and statues instead, and it soon fell.
  The tower lay unoccupied, until `the alchemist' -- a noble who took to the study of alchemy -- set himself up there, along with a few servants and a hidden store of treasure.
\end{exampletext}

\end{multicols}

\section{Journey to the Black Alchemist}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\subsection{Lights in the Night}

Night's darkness allows the \glspl{pc} to see two fires.
The first lies 3 miles away, North West.
The fire hosts a camp of cowardly \gls{guard} who fled their posts when the goblinoid horde descended.

The second lies 4 miles North, and comes from the alchemist's tower.

\begin{boxtext}
  Once the sky goes black, you perceive little lights in the distance.
  Once lies low.
  The other seems higher (but lower than the feint starlight), and flickers blue on occasion, but seems far weaker.
\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{If the troupe head towards either light,}
they will have to descend into the forest, at which point they can no longer see the lights.

Finding the lights requires an \roll{Intelligence}{Wyldcrafting} roll, \tn[9].
Each Margin of failure on the roll adds an extra mile to the journey.

\paragraph{Marching through the forest}
inflicts 1 \gls{fatigue} every mile travelled.%
\exRef{core}{the core rules}{fatigue}

\paragraph{Remaining on the hill}
means no food, and goblins skulking around the area at night.

However, the goblin horde will be easy to avoid as long as the troupe don't light a fire or make any noise.

\subsection{The Cowardly Guards}

\begin{speechtext}
  ``There's no use fighting giants, you know?

  Like, we can't expect to survive, so no use in getting eaten, you know?

  If we stayed, we'd just be in some giant's belly right now, and that would actually be worse.

  You understand, right?''
\end{speechtext}

The \glspl{guard} sit, in a circle, around a small pot of soup, unaware that their fire has caught the interest of distant goblins scouts.

\subsubsection{Introductions}

The \glspl{guard} have a massive pot of soup, stolen from household supplies just before they fled the towns.
Six meals -- enough for themselves and a few more.

Find the \glspl{guard} stats in the handouts.

\paragraph{If a \gls{pc} has died,}
you can introduce a new one here.

Allow the players a moment to take stock of their situation.
Have any of the original group survived?
Everyone has come so far!

And while they talk, little goblins watch the fire, hungrily, then return to the warren to report.

\goblin[\npc{\N\T[4]}{\arabic{noAppearing} Goblin Scouts}]

\paragraph{Spotting the goblin scouts}
requires a \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} roll against the goblins' \roll{Dexterity}{Stealth} (\tn).

\paragraph{If the troupe decide to rest,}
they will have to designate watchmen for the night.
Keeping watch inflicts 3 \glspl{fatigue}, which the troupe can divide between themselves in any way they wish.

\paragraph{If the party befriend the \glspl{guard}}
they will divide the watch phase between the two groups.
Otherwise, the \glspl{guard} will keep watch, whether or not the \glspl{pc} do so.

Have the party roll \roll{Charisma}{Empathy} (\tn[10]).

\subsubsection{The Ogre Ambush}

If the party spotted and killed the goblins, all is well.
Otherwise, ogres will return to capture and eat everyone around the fire.

\ogre

\paragraph{Spotting the ogres}
requires a \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} roll, against the ogres' \roll{Dexterity}{Stealth} (\tn).

\subsection{The Chitincrawler}

En route to the tower, the party run into a chitincrawler's web.
Have them roll \roll{Wits}{Vigilance}, \tn[10].
This is a group roll, so the check counts against the first three characters (probably those with the highest \roll{Speed}{Athletics}).

\chitincrawler

\paragraph{If the chitincrawler passes its Morale check,}
it attacks.%
\exRef{judgement}{Judgement}{morale}

\subsection{Footprints}

Have the party make a Teamwork Roll of \roll{Wits}{Survival}, \tn[10].
Success indicates that one has spotted nura footprints nearby.

\begin{boxtext}

  The dark forest has no roads, but despite this you notice the smallest hint of a trampled path.
  Wandering over, you find two distinct types of footprints -- one very large, and another very small.

\end{boxtext}

The characters guess at least a dozen goblins, and half a dozen ogres, from the footprints.

\subsubsection{Consumed Villages}

If the troupe approach any villages, they find them already consumed by the horde.
If the \glspl{guard} joined them, they will refuse to approach any villages.

The villages sometimes have some of the goblin horde remaining.
Roll to find the inhabitants:


\begin{itemize}
  \item
  $(1D6 - 3)\times 5$ goblins.
  \item
  $(1D6 - 3)\times 3$ ogres.
  \item
  Any village with goblins still around has $1D6$ farmers, tied up and waiting to be eaten.
\end{itemize}

\end{multicols}

\section{The Black Tower}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\noindent
\begin{exampletext}
  The rampant goblin horde, having eaten their way through the villages, have invaded the black tower.
  If they can secure this outpost, they can travel farther, eventually reaching farther villages.

  The bridge here provides the only place to cross the massive river, so if the troupe stop the horde progressing, they will have limited the horde's reach substantially.
\end{exampletext}

\smolMapPic{Dyson_Logos/black_tower_base}{
  \ref{towerBridge}/24/45,
  \ref{towerPortcullis}/46/66,
}

\subsection{The Approach}

The Alchemist sits at the top of the tower, and will wave to the troupe.

\begin{boxtext}

  Ahead, a wide, raging river stands in front of the black tower, which is in fact a grey colour typical of the slate in the area.
  At the top, a man wearing a long, dark robe, watches your approach.

\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{If anyone shouts towards the Alchemist,}
he remains silent and indicates the danger in the tower below him, as he does not want to draw attention to himself.

\mapentry[towerBridge]{The Bridge}

The bridge is a simple stone construction, which stays put.
Below, it is supported by wood, and can be taken apart with a \roll{Strength}{Crafts} roll, \tn[14].
Proper tools, such as a saw, can add up to a +4 Bonus.

\paragraph{If the troupe approach during daylight,}
a goblin spellcaster, watching from \nameref{towerServants} (room \ref{towerServants}) spots them, and begins casting offensive spells.

\mapentry[towerPortcullis]{The Portcullis}

Two ogres stand inside, happily eating a horse.
They have lowered the gates, so the troupe cannot rush in to attack.

\ogre[\npc{\N\T[2]}{2 Ogres}]

\paragraph{Raising the portcullis}
requires a total of 6 Strength points, so the party will have a difficult time doing this on their own.

\paragraph{Going around the back of the tower}
means edging along the narrow earthy edge.
This demands a \roll{Dexterity}{Athletics} (\tn[10]).%
\footnote{Remember, anyone wants to go around the outside, start by asking \emph{all} the players if they want to go around the outside, before the roll occurs.}

\paragraph{If anyone ends up in the river,}
have them roll \roll{Speed}{Athletics}, \tn[9].
Failure indicates they have been washed downstream, and must take \pgls{interval} trudging back.%
\iftoggle{core}{%
  \footnote{Larger party members carrying small ones will gain the standard penalties for carrying a heavy item (or in this case, `party member').
  See the core rules, \autopageref{weight}.}

}

\mapentry[exStable]{The Stable}

Further goblins hide in here, eating a horse the ogres left for them.

\goblin

\begin{boxtext}
  Opening the door, the blood-sodden stable only hosts \arabic{noAppearing} goblins, swarming over a horse corpse, and competing with a mass of flies to see how quickly they can consume the beast.
\end{boxtext}

\mapentry[towerArmoury]{The Armoury}

\begin{exampletext}
  Whenever the \gls{guard} came to the tower, the Alchemist had excellent weapons waiting for them.
  This ensured they kept on good terms with him, and that he had a rotation of well-armed guards.
\end{exampletext}

\begin{boxtext}

  Outside, a full moon glimpses in through the arrow slits in the walls.
  Goblins have clearly vandalized this armoury, but the armour itself remains undamaged.
  To your left, a spiral staircase leads upward.

  Down the hall, the tower continues round.
  Human feet can be seen lying there.

\end{boxtext}

\smolMapPic{Dyson_Logos/black_tower_f2}{
  \ref{towerArmoury}/59/64,
  \ref{towerMechanism}/25/43,
}

The party can pick up three suits of chainmail for anyone with Strength 2-3, and three longswords.

The human feet across the room belonged to the Alchemist's servant, who kept the place tidy, and helped with the portcullis.
He has been eaten, and little remains except his boots, blood, and bones.

\mapentry[towerMechanism]{The Portcullis Mechanism}

Here, the cogs which control the portcullises sit unused.
They require only a Strength Bonus of +1 to operate.

\mapentry[towerKitchen]{Kitchen}

The kitchen still holds 6 meals, but the ogre will eat all of it soon enough.

\begin{boxtext}

  Traipsing up the steps, you hear the sound of angry mastication.
  At the top, you see an open door, with an ogre inside a kitchen, pulling down fruits with one hand and salted meats with the other.

  He looks up at you, but does not stop eating.

\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{If the party look formidable but unthreatening,}
the ogre leaves them be.
Otherwise, he attacks.

  \ref{towerKitchen}/25/75,

}

\mapentry[towerServants]{Servant's Room}

A goblin spellcaster stands here, watching for anyone approaching.

\goblincaster

\showStdSpells

\mapentry[towerStorage]{Storage Room}

This room contains spare clothing and all manner of long-life food.
The nura have not managed to figure out the lock yet.
It has no key -- instead, there is a hole with a series of ropes inside which one must lift in the correct way.
An \roll{Intelligence}{Larceny} check \tn[10] is required to figure out how to open it.

\mapentry[towerLibrary]{Library}

The library contains myriad books on history, alchemy, political tracts in support of a monarchy, and analyses of the afterlives we all go to once the gods take us.

A single goblin hides underneath a table.
It feels scared by the big people approaching, and waits to stab a player from hiding, then bolt downstairs.

\begin{boxtext}

  Stellar maps cover the walls, full of numbers etched into the side.
  The desks have etches of Sunlit deserts, with strange geometrical shapes.
  Scrolls have calculations concerning abstract coordinates, such as `area C', with no mention of what that area may be.

  Myriad books lie in a heap, next to a conspicuously blank wall.

\end{boxtext}

\goblin[\npc{\N\F}{Hiding Goblin}]

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} fail to spot the hiding goblin,}
it attempts a sneak attack, then bolts down the stairs.
\exRef{core}{Core rules}{sneakattack}

\paragraph{Searching for particularly valuable books}
requires an \roll{Intelligence}{Academics} roll (\tn[12]).

\paragraph{Once the \glspl{pc} enter}
they notice a trapdoor in the roof.

If any goblins enter, they will be fried by the Black Alchemist, but the players only need to shout up in a friendly voice, and say they mean no harm to come up without being incinerated.

\mapentry[towerBaron]{the Alchemist's Room}

The room is a mess, but a mess made of fine quilts and quality pillows.

Around the room are:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item{A jar with the web-spinning organ of a chitincrawler, soaked in wine.}
  \item{A rare green gem, worth 40 \glspl{gp}.%
  \footnote{Finding a buyer will prove difficult.}}
  \item{The preserved eyeballs of Coltrank the seer.
  It could make an excellent \gls{ingredient} for a Fate spell.}
  \item
  A magical item, hidden in a drawer:

\end{enumerate}

\lootMagic 

\mapentry[towerRoof]{The Roof}

\begin{exampletext}
  The Alchemist has lit a bonfire, made from a broken bookshelf.
  He has enchanted it to flicker blue in order to call for aid.
  When goblins poke their heads up, he uses his magical abilities to blast them off the side of the tower, or have the bonfire consume them.
\end{exampletext}

\paragraph{Once the party enter,}
the Baron allows them to come up, greets them politely, and listens to anything they have to say.

\smolMapPic{Dyson_Logos/black_tower_f5}{
  \ref{towerStorage}/60/54,
}

\paragraph{If any party members have died,}
a new \gls{pc} can be found here.
This might be someone in the employ of the Alchemist, or a random person who was in the deep forest and ran away from the horde, then took shelter in the tower.

\paragraph{While the troupe make their introductions,}
the goblins below feel hungry again, and ascend the tower.
List out all enemies the troupe have not eliminated: all of them join together and plan their attack.

\section{The Journey Back}
\label{siege}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\noindent
Keep a tally of Fatigue, and have the players make proper decisions.
If they decide to return home immediately, they have one encounter with a basilisk.
If they wish to rest and recover, throw in another encounter.

\subsection{Discovering the Theft}

If the players have stolen anything precious from the Alchemist, he might notice if they do not hide it well enough.
Have the player roll their \roll{Intelligence}{Larceny} against the baron's \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} (so \tn).
Failure indicates that while rummaging through a bag to take out food or equipment, they have revealed the stolen item for a moment.

If the Alchemist sees a stolen item, he will remember, and attempt to kill the character later.
Make a note of his intentions -- he understands the value of patience well.

\subsection{The Basilisk}

\begin{boxtext}

  A nasty stench approaches as you hear branches and trees being pushed aside and flattened.

\end{boxtext}

The party will notice the basilisk coming a mile away, and have time to prepare.
This gives a great opportunity to see what the Black Alchemist can do, as he rains hell-fire on the basilisk, with a Fire spell.

\basilisk

If seriously damaged, the basilisk retreats.
