\mapentry{Entrance Hallway}

At the other side of this door sits the lonely guard, Bobble.
He only turned into a goblin recently, and he doesn't like it.
He is also extremely hungry.

\paragraph{If the party attempt to trick Bobble,}
it's not terribly difficult.

\paragraph{If the party simple enter,}
then Bobble will run as fast as he can, away from the door, in order to alert the rest of the upper warren.

\goblin[\npc{\N\M}{Bobble}]

\mapentry{Banquet Hall}

\begin{boxtext}

	The door at the top of the stairs reveals a large banquet hall.
	Human bones lie on the table, all polished clean.
	The cups and cutlery lie smashed and broken.
	At the far end of the hallway, a door stands ajar.
	On the right, a passageway with a hint of sunlight.

\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{If the players search the table,}
they can find a knife which functions as a dagger.

\mapentry{The Spiral Staircase Exit}

\begin{boxtext}

	In the sunlit intersection of four hallways, three ogres sit playing a game of dice.
	Each one is clad in leather armour, and has a massive sword by its side.

\end{boxtext}

The party can see the exit, but cannot get up it without near-certain death.
In order to progress, they could do any number of things:

\begin{itemize}

	\item{Trick one of the ogres into chasing them.}
	\item{Find a missile weapon in order to force guardian ogres into chasing them.}
	\item{Distract the ogres with illusions of something, while running up the stairs.}
\end{itemize}

Exactly what plans they come up with and how well they work depends entirely on your players and how their situation emerges.

\paragraph{If the party attempt to get the ogres to chase them,}
one does, but the other two stay put.

\mapentry{The Trapped Hallway}

\begin{boxtext}

	The door swings open with a loud creek, revealing a hallway covered wall-to-wall with sticky webs.
	Two goblin corpses stand upright, pierced in multiple places, with a pool of their own blood lying on the ground.

\end{boxtext}

\begin{exampletext}

	When the nura invaded, three little gnomes found themselves trapped in this little side-room.
	They got together enough food for a few days, and have been waiting since then for someone to come and rescue them.

\end{exampletext}

\paragraph{If anyone tries to wriggle past the webbing,}
have them roll Dexterity + Athletics, TN 12.

\paragraph{If they get caught,}
three gnomes will rush out and try to kill them while they're trapped and unable to defend themselves.
Have them make a Wits + Empathy roll, TN 8, to avoid the initial attack.

\paragraph{If the party use torches to destroy the webs,}
it works okay, but moving through quietly isn't easy.
Have them roll Intelligence + Stealth to plan a route through, without upsetting the goblin corpses (which could fall and clatter), or otherwise make a racket.

\mapentry{The Lounge}

\begin{boxtext}

	Row after row of beds, little hammocks, and tables with old, cold pipes sitting on them stretch across the room.
	In the distance, little voices come through an open doorway.
	They talk lazily, quite unlike the goblinoid chatter you normally hear.

\end{boxtext}

If the party entered secretly, have them roll Wits + Vigilance, TN 8, to notice a dozing gnome.
If the party move through without explaining themselves, he wakes, then sounds the alarm, and Tar\'ik in the far room incinerates the place with a \textit{Wide Fireball}, inflicting $1D6 +3$ Damage.

\mapentry{Trapped Gnomes}

What happens here depends entirely on how the party have come through the previous rooms.

\paragraph{If they shouted in a loud, friendly manner,}
they get a friendly greeting as all the gnomes here thank them for their presumed rescue, and hope to join them in the escape.

These gnomes know the entire warren, and can tell them about the contents of every room.

\paragraph{If the party entered secretly,}
then as soon as the gnomes spot them, they will draw their weapons while Tar\'ik throws invocation spells at them.

\paragraph{If the gnomes join the party,}
remember to keep track of their Fate Points.
Each scene they will regenerate 2.

\setcounter{enc}{\value{list}}
\addtocounter{enc}{1}

\paragraph{Before the party leave,}
the gnomes request they nip out to the kitchen, (room \arabic{enc}) and get them some food.

With proper food, the party and the gnomes can rest, regain any Fatigue Points they may have accumulated, and the gnomes can do the same.

\mapentry{The Kitchen}

\begin{boxtext}

	This Spartan kitchen has pans, pots, and boxes strewn all over the place.
	A fireplace with ventilation through the roof sits to your right.
	Amid the mess of sacks and broken plates, you can see that a little food remains, apparently dumped here.

\end{boxtext}

A recent raiding party managed to get enough food to save, and one of the goblins convinced the ogres to leave it here for later.

If the party want the food, they will have to make a Dexterity + Stealth roll to pilfer it without making any noise, TN 8.
Each margin on the roll gives them enough food to heal 4 Fatigue Points.
They can roll as many times as they like, but each roll carries the danger of being spotted.

\paragraph{If the party make any noise,}
the chasing ogre from the central room rushes after them (Page \pageref{chasingogre}).

\mapentry{The Storage Room}

\begin{boxtext}

	Inside the next room, you find weapons, leather armour, rope, mining supplies, and a desk with a full map on the wall.

	A portal at the other end leads out into a long, dark hallway.

\end{boxtext}

The room contains every item which could be called `Adventuring Equipment',
\iftoggle{core}{%
\footnote{See the core book, page \pageref{start_equipment}}
}{}%
in addition to:

\begin{itemize}

	\item{10 shortswords}
	\item{2 suits of partial leather (for someone with Strength 2)}
	\item{1 suit of partial leather (for someone with Strength 1)}
	\item{A longbow for Strength +2}
	\item{3 quivers of 20 arrows}

\end{itemize}

If the party examine the map on the wall, they find it to be a map of the current level of the warren.
See Appendix \ref{handouts} for the map.

\mapentry{The Woodspy Pool}

\begin{boxtext}

	In the distance, you can see a massive pool of water shimmering in the dark room.
	It seems to move a little, as if it had its own subtle tides.

\end{boxtext}

\begin{exampletext}

	The gnomes once bread woodspies in this little pool.
	They would chuck in various leftover food and organic waste from the surface world, and as soon as a woodspy laid some eggs, the gnomes would catch it and eat it.
	They never presented a danger, so long as they stayed small.

	Since then, the nuramancers decided to cast a spell on two of them, turning them into nura.
	They ate all the others, and now sit hungrily, at the bottom of the pool.

\end{exampletext}

\nurawoodspy[\npc{\A\N}{2 Nura Woodspies}]

\paragraph{If any non-nura attempt to run past the pool of water,}
the woodspies within reach up and try to grab them.

\paragraph{If the PCs attempt to shoot at the woodspies,}
then the woodspies retreat into the water, where they cannot be hit by anything.
