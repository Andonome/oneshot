\mapentry{Banquet Hall}

\begin{boxtext}

	The door at the top of the stairs reveals a large banquet hall.
	Human bones lie on the table, all polished clean.
	The cups and cutlery lie smashed and broken.
	At the far end of the hallway, a door stands ajar.
	On the right, a passageway with a hint of sunlight.

\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{If the players search the table,}
they can find a knife which functions as a dagger.

\mapentry{The Spiral Staircase Exit}

\begin{boxtext}

	In the sunlit intersection of four hallways, three ogres sit playing a game of dice.
	Each one is clad in leather armour, and has a massive sword by its side.
