\mapentry{Entrance Hallway}

At the other side of this door sits the lonely guard, Bobble.
He only turned into a goblin recently, and he doesn't like it.
He is also extremely hungry.

\paragraph{If the party attempt to trick Bobble,}
it's not terribly difficult.

\paragraph{If the party simple enter,}
then Bobble will run as fast as he can, away from the door, in order to alert the rest of the upper warren.

\mapentry{Banquet Hall}

\begin{boxtext}

	The door at the top of the stairs reveals a large banquet hall.
	Human bones lie on the table, all polished clean.
	The cups and cutlery lie smashed and broken.
	At the far end of the hallway, a door stands ajar.
	On the right, a passageway with a hint of sunlight.

\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{If the players search the table,}
they can find a knife which functions as a dagger.

\mapentry{The Spiral Staircase Exit}

\begin{boxtext}

	In the sunlit intersection of four hallways, three ogres sit playing a game of dice.
	Each one is clad in leather armour, and has a massive sword by its side.

\end{boxtext}

The party can see the exit, but cannot get up it without near-certain death.
In order to progress, they could do any number of things:

\begin{itemize}

	\item{Trick one of the ogres into chasing them.}
	\item{Find a missile weapon in order to force guardian ogres into chasing them.}
	\item{Distract the ogres with illusions of something, while running up the stairs.}
\end{itemize}

Exactly what plans they come up with and how well they work depends entirely on your players and how their situation emerges.

\paragraph{If the party attempt to get the ogres to chase them,}
one does, but the other two stay put.

\mapentry{The Trapped Hallway}

\begin{boxtext}

	The door swings open with a loud creek, revealing a hallway covered wall-to-wall with sticky webs.
	Two goblin corpses stand upright, pierced in multiple places, with a pool of their own blood lying on the ground.

\end{boxtext}

\begin{exampletext}

	When the nura invaded, three little gnomes found themselves trapped in this little side-room.
	They got together enough food for a few days, and have been waiting since then for someone to come and rescue them.

\end{exampletext}

\paragraph{If anyone tries to wriggle past the webbing,}
have them roll Dexterity + Athletics, TN 12.

\paragraph{If they get caught,}
three gnomes will rush out and try to kill them while they're trapped and unable to defend themselves.
Have them make a Wits + Empathy roll, TN 8, to avoid the initial attack.

\paragraph{If the party use torches to destroy the webs,}
it works okay, but moving through quietly isn't easy.
Have them roll Intelligence + Stealth to plan a route through, without upsetting the goblin corpses (which could fall and clatter), or otherwise make a racket.

\mapentry{The Lounge}

\begin{boxtext}

	Row after row of beds, little hammocks, and tables with old, cold pipes sitting on them stretch across the room.
	In the distance, little voices come through an open doorway.
	They talk lazily, quite unlike the goblinoid chatter you normally hear.

\end{boxtext}

If the party entered secretly, have them roll Wits + Vigilance, TN 8, to notice a dozing gnome.
If the party move through without explaining themselves, he wakes, then sounds the alarm, and Tar\'ik in the far room incinerates the place with a \textit{Wide Fireball}, inflicting $1D6 +3$ Damage.

\mapentry{Trapped Gnomes}

What happens here depends entirely on how the party have come through the previous rooms.

\paragraph{If they shouted in a loud, friendly manner,}
they get a friendly greeting as all the gnomes here thank them for their presumed rescue, and hope to join them in the escape.

These gnomes know the entire warren, and can tell them about the contents of every room.

\paragraph{If the party entered secretly,}
then as soon as the gnomes spot them, they will draw their weapons while Tar\'ik throws invocation spells at them.

\paragraph{If the gnomes join the party,}
remember to keep track of their Fate Points.
Each scene they will regenerate 2.
