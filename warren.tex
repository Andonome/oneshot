\newRule{Team Rolls}{

  \input{config/rules/actions_team.tex}

  \paragraph{Example 1:}
  the troupe are sneaking down a hallway, and have to roll \roll{Stealth}{Dexterity} (\tn[9]).
  One player rolls $2D6$, and gets a `7'.
  Characters with a total bonus of +2 were walking quietly, but if even a single \gls{pc} had a bonus of +1 or less, they made a noise, and the entire group is given away.

  \paragraph{Example 2:}
  The characters try to persuade Chris to help them, and one player rolls the dice, getting a `7'.
  Their \roll{Charisma}{Empathy} total is -1, so they fail, but another character tries to speak with him and has a +3 total, so they succeed (without rolling the dice again).

\mapentry[entrycell]{Cells}

\begin{exampletext}

  Gnomes erected cots, cribs and hammocks here to be used as a communal sleeping area.
  Since then, goblins have placed a bar over the outside of the door to house prisoners.

\end{exampletext}

Here the \glspl{pc} awaken to their hopeless situation.

\begin{itemize}

    Ask the players to mark down $1D6$ \glspl{fatigue} on their character sheets from the trials they've experienced getting here, and of course from their hunger.

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{If anyone tries to wriggle free of their ropes,}
have them roll \roll{Dexterity}{Larceny},

\paragraph{After a moment,}
a small voice from the corner of the room says

\begin{quotation}
  \noindent
  ``No use in struggling.
  They will eat us soon no matter what we do''.
\end{quotation}

The ogres captured Chris from a nearby village, along with others.
When the goblinoid hordes entered, Chris hid in the side of the room while his companions fought.
He's learnt how to survive through cowardice and will keep himself as safe as he can from now on.

\paragraph{If anyone asks Chris for help,}
he refuses, and explains why they are powerless, and may as well wait to be eaten.
If they say they want to fight, he explains how large ogres stand, and how many wait above.
If they say that they want to die fighting, and to untie them, then he explains that he can't trust them, and that they might throw him out the door first.
He would rather take his chances hiding in the dark.

\paragraph{Every time the \glspl{pc} give Chris a reason to hope,}
have them roll \roll{Charisma}{Empathy} at \iftoggle{oneshot}{\tn[9]}{\tn[11]}.
Success means that Chris will untie them.
A tie means he asks a follow-up question (allowing another re-roll if they can answer him well).
A failure means he disengages, muttering ``no, it won't work''.

\paragraph{Shortly after,}
Blara the goblin nuramancer, and Olf the ogre walk towards the cell.

\begin{boxtext}

  Heavy footsteps pad down the hall, you hear the door's bar being lifted, and a little goblinoid face peeps in with a torch.
  Behind her, an ogre stoops to the height of a man to avoid the low ceiling.

\end{boxtext}

Olf then tries to pick up a character, and take it up to the kitchen.

they can do so with a -4 penalty to the roll.

\newRule{End of \Glsentrytext{interval} Regeneration}{
  \input{config/rules/interval.tex}

  Being underground, the \glspl{pc} will only regenerate 1 \gls{mp} per interval, which goes to whichever \gls{pc} has the most \glspl{mp} lost.

  Of course the \glspl{pc} won't know exactly how long they've spent underground, but they will at least be able to count the number of resting periods they take.
}

\mapentry[escapeShaft]{Fire Room}

\begin{exampletext}
  A fire burns low in this alcove, casting long shadows across the room.%
  \footnote{The gnomes built this shaft to mine below, but once they had a lift to transport them more easily, they stopped using the stone ladder.
  Once abandoned, they decided to make it into a fireplace, by adding a chimney to the surface.}
\end{exampletext}

If the \glspl{pc} look around the fire, they will notice hand-holds carved into the rock on the left.
If they climb while the fire burns, the smoke coming up will make them choke and cough, inflicting \pgls{fatigue}.

Climbing to the top requires a \roll{Speed}{Athletics} roll at \tn[13], and every point rolled below 13 inflicts \pgls{fatigue}.
E.g. a character rolling a total of `5' would gain 8 \glspl{fatigue}.

The \glspl{pc} cannot see how far up this shaft goes, so they will have to track it moment by moment.
Give any player who climbs up one or two \glspl{fatigue} at a time, and each time, ask them if they want to continue (without knowing how far they have to go) or go back down (and receive the same number of \glspl{fatigue} as before, minus 2).

\paragraph{Once at the top of the ladder,}
this chimney has an alcove for a furnace in the workshop, above.
Any \gls{pc} will hear the goblins talking.

\paragraph{Breaking through the furnace}
needs a \roll{Intelligence}{Crafts}, \tn[6].
Failure inflicts $1D6$ Damage as some goof pulls hot coals from the furnace onto the character.

If anyone succeeds in breaking that furnace, they certainly make a lot of noise, and find themselves at room \ref{workshop}.

\paragraph{If someone wants to continue climbing up,}
the chimney becomes smaller and smaller, then eventually breaks out into various hand-sized tunnels, and exits above, almost invisibly.

\mapentry[diningRoom]{Dining Room}

\begin{boxtext}

  As you climb the dark stairway, you see a tiny candle's light above, and hear shouting and thrashing.
  The floor at the top is strewn with pots and plates, knives, forks and candlesticks.
  It looks like a pack of ravenous dogs swept through here and licked ever morsel from every surface.

\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{If a \gls{pc} sneaks up quietly,}
have them roll \roll{Dexterity}{Stealth},  at \tn[9].

They should get a +2 bonus for leaving any lights behind.

\begin{boxtext}

  In the middle of the room you can see two creatures wrestling on a table -- a goblin and the other you would call a rat, but only if the rat had been mated with a Great Dane.
  The two creatures are fighting over a human leg.

\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} wait patiently and silently,}
the nura rat and goblin will leave.
The goblin will go up the lift, and the rat will wander the hall, searching for more food.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} make a sound,}

\begin{itemize}

  \item
  the goblin grabs the candle on the table (which puts it out),
  \item
  then he runs out of the room, shouting for a nuramancer in area \ref{spellCasters}.
  \item
  The rat attacks the \glspl{pc} immediately.

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} enter combat,}
they take 1 \gls{fatigue}.

Once the spell is cast, all creatures with 11 \glspl{hp} or fewer in the surrounding 3 areas, instantly raise from the dead as ghouls.
See \autoref{creaturesAndItems} for stats on the various ghouls.

Unlike other magical items in this area, this scroll was made by a nuramancer (not a gnome), so the command word is written plainly in the Trade Tongue (which many nura speak).
The scroll contains the epic of Logan, an Elvish poem.
Once the last line is spoken, the scroll activates (the rest does not need to be spoken).

it begins to shimmer with golden flecks, and four rounds later the portal destroys itself, creating a magical portal to another realm.

\paragraph{When leaving this alcove,}
the \glspl{pc} head towards the blinding light.

  Turning away from the table in the little alcove, the hallway ahead drops into two shadowy openings, and on the right daylight floods in through a passage, almost blinding you.

\mapentry[desertPortal]{Magic Portal}

\begin{boxtext}
  Shielding your eyes, you turn right and head towards the light.

  Just four steps down the passage, you find the Sunlight coming from a massive opening on the right.
  A warm wind blows through the portal and on the other side you can see an endless desert of bright, yellow rocks.
  Strange symbols and gemstones sit around the opening's perimeter.

  On the left, double doors made of wood stare into the light.
  Then passageway continues, but becomes quickly lost in darkness.

they can read the runes above the magical portal; they read ``Realm of Bright Rocks''.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} enter the portal and journey through the Realm of Bright Rocks,}
they won't find much -- not even a place to hide, given the desert is expansive and flat.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} have avoided making a lot of noise nearby,}
then the goblins are asleep in the kitchen.

\begin{boxtext}

The door creaks open and as you peer into the darkness you can just make out the four figures sprawled over tables and chairs or curled up on the oven, snoring quietly.
From the embers of the hearth you can see the ovens and cooking utensils that make up a substantial kitchen, and silhouettes of human femurs and skulls.

Opening the door further, the light from the hall's sconces fills the room, and you can see that the four figures are more goblins with little fat bellies.
At the end of the kitchen you can see a large door to a cold store with a lock on it and some large cleavers stuck into a butchers block.

  The Morale check only uses the Combat Skill at \tn[5], with some modifiers.

  \paragraph{If the goblins fail the Morale Check,}
  they attempt to flee into the prison cell the \glspl{pc} just came from.

  Their Morale check remains throughout the combat, without needing to re-roll it.
  If they roll a `7' from the start, then a Goblin with Combat +1 will have a total of `8', and one with Combat +2 would have `9'.
  If the \glspl{pc} outnumber the goblins, and one is stronger than them, then their total would become `5' and `6'.
  If a goblin became wounded, they would flee, but the others might stay.

\mapentry[dragonApproach]{Dragon's Approach}

\begin{exampletext}

  Once the gnomes turned into nura, they neglected to de-activate the portal, as it's easier to see when it's open.
  A couple of hours ago, a dragon named `Makil' wandered in, and went up the stairs towards the treasure room, but could not fit through the little gnomish door.
  He managed to pull a chest full of copper coinage through the door, but could not get anything else as he could not reach.

  The Makil wanted to barter with the goblins, but found that they responded to him either by trying to fight him, or by running away, and none spoke elvish (the only language he knows spoken in these parts).

  The cautious beast won't approach the nura to attack when he has no idea how many there are around him.
  He may be powerful, but a room full of ogres alongside a spell caster could seriously injure or kill him, and he doesn't want to take the chance.
  Similarly, the nura don't want to take any chances, so they've decided to just leave him where he is.

  The nura and dragon have ended with a stalemate, so he has taken a nap.

\end{exampletext}

\begin{boxtext}

  Ahead, three charred goblin corpses lie on the ground.
  A strange scent wanders down from above, something like a chicken cooked in sulphur.

Despite his linguistic deficits, he can communicate using the Enchantment sphere to send ideas to characters.

\paragraph{If the party request he kill nura for them}
then he agrees to kill any in the current area, but will not journey to another floor.
In return, he wants all the treasure out of the treasure room.

the dragon asks if they would like to challenge him to a game of riddles.
Each point anyone scores allows them to demand a single item, such as a chest, or quiver.

If they say `yes', then he accepts their challenge, and asks what their riddle is.%
\footnote{Use of the internet is prohibited by trans-dimensional law, common sense, basic decency, and the Geneva Convention.}
If they can think of none,
then the dragon declares that he has won the first round.

\paragraph{The rules for riddles}
are simple -- any question which someone has the knowledge to answer is a fair riddle.
Asking `how many letters in the Greek word for ``mushroom''?', is not a fair riddle, because someone may not know.

Any possible answer to a riddle is `the correct one'.
If someone asks `what is black and white and read all over', anything which fits all descriptions must be accepted as an answer.

See \autoref{riddles} for riddles.

\paragraph{If the players ask why he wants treasure,}
he explains that he wants to attract a mate; when his flame becomes hot enough to melt the gold, he will carve a golden statue of the most deadly dragon in his area in order to attract her attention.
He will then decorate the statue with magical items.
\footnote{Would you prefer a mate is beautiful, or one that can kill anything in an instant?
Dragons think the answer is obvious.}

\paragraph{If the dragon parts on good terms,}
he blesses them all with a \textit{Wide Blessing} (which heals $2D6$ \glspl{fp}), and casts a \textit{Fortune} spell on the weakest member, allowing them to receive +1 to their Combat Skill for the rest of the adventure.

\iftoggle{oneshot}{
  \paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} attack the dragon,}
  he kills the first to attack.

  His {\scshape \gls{dr} 5} means he reduces all Damage by 5, unless the attacker hits 5 over the \gls{tn} to attack him (a total of 15), achieving a `Vitals Shot'.

\begin{exampletext}

  When the nura arrived, the gnomes put their children in here, then left enough food for a few days, locked the door, and destroyed the key.
  Unfortunately, those gnomes have turned into goblins, and if they entered the room they would probably eat their own children.

\end{exampletext}

The door is locked, but can be picked with a \roll{Dexterity}{Larceny} check, \tn[9].
It's far too strong to be broken into by force.
If the \glspl{pc} enter the room, they may think these little gnomes are little goblins and kill them.

\mapentry[slugHall]{Slug Hall}

\begin{boxtext}

  The doorway reveals a massive hallway of sparkling, floating, lights.
  Across the earthy floor, pieces of paper lie everywhere.
  Giant slugs lazily wander, masticating them.
  Half of the slugs wear the pages, as if someone had thrown the paper in the room from above.
  Around those pages, little grubs eat into the massive slugs.
  The moment you enter, their eye-stalks perk up, and they begin to slide off the corpses they were feasting on.
  To your left, stairs head upwards into darkness.

\end{boxtext}

\begin{exampletext}

Gnomes grew mushrooms throughout this room in order to grow slugs, so that they could feed fireflies.
While torches work best, having omnipresent fireflies around the warren makes sure that people can coordinate between rooms without worrying about light.

Since then, the nura turned those slugs into nura slugs.
The fireflies have survived on the enlarged slug, which the nura keep alive with the scraps they don't want to eat, such as mushrooms and bones and faeces.

\end{exampletext}

\nuraslug[\npc{\T[9]\N}{20 Nura Slugs}]

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} run up the stairs,}
have them roll initiative against the slugs.

From that point until the slugs loose sight of them, they are in combat.
The slugs will spray acid at them, follow them up the stairs, and pester them for as long as they remain in sight.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} throw in some food,}
the nura slugs chase it rather than them.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} manage to investigate the corpses somehow,}
they find two dead gnomes, one with a torch, the other with a Portal Scroll.
\iftoggle{oneshot}{%
  As with the others, the Portal Scroll requires a riddle to be answered, takes four rounds before it activates, and vanishes once used.

\mapentry[greatHall]{The Great Hallway}

\begin{boxtext}

  At the top of the stairs, this massive chamber lies empty, except for the fireflies darting about, and a few human bones.
  To the right, there are two short tunnels.
  Ahead of you, two grand staircases lead up into a dim but unwavering light.
  Below you, the entire floor is sticky and greasy.
  Somewhere close, you hear snoring.

\end{boxtext}

If the \glspl{pc} have indeed been quiet enough in the previous room to not raise an alarm, they find everyone in nearby rooms napping.
A single sound means they will be in serious trouble.

The greasy floor results from a mixture of faeces, drool, blood and leftover mushroom-juice.
Anyone who can use Conjuration magic will be able to turn the offal on the floor into a slippery substance.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} have come from room \ref{slugHall},}
they will not immediately see the staircase on their left, but will see it after doing literally anything (fighting, searching, et c.).

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} tarry or talk,}
have them make a \roll{Dexterity}{Stealth} check, \tn[6].
They make this as a \textit{Group Roll}, so a single roll counts for the whole group.
Each margin on the roll allows them an additional round before the horde wakes.

\mapentry[workshop]{The Workshop}

\label{laddertop}

\begin{boxtext}

  Some goblins and three ogres lie sleeping on the floor between workbenches.
  The place is so full, you can't make out how many lie here, but the snoring indicates more than you can see.
  On the benches, most of the equipment lies broken, but obviously delicate gnomish hands once used these tables to polish gems, craft magical items, and forge digging equipment.
  On one table, you can see a pile of weapons -- short swords and spears -- piled on a table.

\end{boxtext}

\begin{exampletext}

  Frightened gnomes fled their bedrooms from the nura who had rushed through the portal.
  Most were caught, but some managed to run up the trapped ladders, having memorized the sequence perfectly.
  As the last one got to the top of the ladders, he turned to cast an illusion of a solid wall in order to fool anyone coming up behind him.

\end{exampletext}

Picks, shovels, wood, short swords, shortbows, and all manner of crafting and mining equipment litter the room.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} have come up from room \ref{entrycell},}
they find the exit has been covered by an illusion of a wall.
If they investigate the area at all, the illusion fades, revealing the sleeping nura.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} attempt to take either a short sword or a spear,}
each attempt requires a \roll{Dexterity}{Stealth} roll, \tn[7].
Failure will awaken the entire horde.

  At the top of the stairs you find the ruins of a massive library.
  Book cases lie in a smashed heap on the ground, others appear to be used as a makeshift bed for an ogre.
  The books themselves are gone, except for a few scrolls, now tightly clutched by a goblin in a black cowl.
  His hand shines with a thumb-ring, showing three massive gemstones.

\end{boxtext}

In total, the room contains the following magical items:

\magicitem{Bowl of Water}{Conjuration}{Alchemy}{2 Scenes}{Talisman}{4}{3}

This bowl is always full of water.
If it empties, then the air around it quickly forms into more water.

\magicitem{Lock Scroll}{Lock}{Alchemy}{2 Scenes}{Pocket Spell}{4}{3}

This lock scroll will lock any door, increasing the \gls{tn} to break through it by 4.

As with any Portal Scroll, it leads to the Realm of Shifting Corridors.

\magicitem{Ring of Wishes}%
{Conjuration 4}%
{Alchemy}%
{5 Scenes}%
{Talisman $\times 3$}%
{5}%
{7}

This ring is actually three pocket spells -- each ruby in the ring is a separate magical item, and each use will make one ruby go dark.

The caster can summon anything available for Conjuration level 4.
With 7 \glspl{mp}, the ring has a Metamagic score of 7, allowing it to cast \textit{Wide} spells, and other Metamagic enhancements.

{Pocket Spell}%
{4}%
{3}

The spell allows the user to feel 4 areas around (meaning `rooms'), though not with much detail.
The effect feels very disorienting at first, as most people are not used to having their consciousness spread apart so far.

\magicitem{Staff of Light}%
{Wide Light}%
{Alchemy}%
{Continuous}%
{Talisman}%
{3}%
{3}

This `staff' will probably feel more like a wand in the hands of a human, as it's about the height of a short gnome.
The gnomish word for `morning', activates the light, while the gnomish word for `night' stops it.
The nura do not know, or have forgotten, these activation words, so they simply keep it under blankets as they find the light irritating.

If wrapped up in heavy sheets and suddenly displayed, the light can blind opponents, as usual.

\paragraph{If any of the \glspl{pc} attempt to sneak in,}
have them roll \roll{Dexterity}{Stealth}, \tn[8].

Failure will, of course, spell disaster, but success will allow them to steal a magical item.
If the player wants to steal multiple magical items, describe them and see how many they decide to take.
Each item taken increases the roll's \gls{tn} by 1, so taking 3 items would mean a \gls{tn} of 11.
The player should not roll again -- the original roll remains, but increasing the \gls{tn} may well turn success into awful failure.

The squares between the exit door and the party's path can turn anyone stepping upon them into stone.
One goblin was unfortunate enough to trigger the trap.
The second goblin did not believe the original goblins about why the first was there, and ignored the statue, so he was turned to stone too.

This magical trap didn't look quite right when the flagstones had to be inlaid with gems in order to complete the alchemical spell -- that kind of shine gives the game away.
The gnomes' solution was to make sure \textit{all} flagstones had a magical amulet in them, so nobody could tell which might hold a deadly spell.
