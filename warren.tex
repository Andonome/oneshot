\section{The Lowest Level}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\setcounter{list}{0}

\mapentry{Rooms}

\begin{exampletext}

	Gnomes erected cots, cribs and hammocks here to be used as a communal sleeping area.
	Since then, goblins have placed a bar over the outside of the door to house prisoners.

\end{exampletext}

\begin{boxtext}

	You awake in darkness with ropes binding your hands behind your back.
	From the shifting and murmuring sounds around, you know others rest in the same room.

\end{boxtext}

Here the PCs awaken to their hopeless situation.
Have everyone roll Dexterity + Larceny against TN 11 to escape.
Run the first event in the time line -- \textit{the Escape} (page \pageref{escape}).

\paragraph{If the PCs make a lot of noise}
then the goblins down the hall are coming for them, and they had better move fast.
Make it clear the party have little chance of success in a head-to-head combat, so they should run the other way.

\paragraph{If the PCs exit quietly,}
they have free reign to explore.

\paragraph{If the party do not manage to escape}
then add 3 Fatigue Points for their time starving in prison, and throw in a load of new prisoners.

Once new prisoners are in, the players can spend Story Points to introduce old friends, and have \textit{them} roll to escape from bondage.

\mapentry{Exit Shaft}

\begin{exampletext}

	This exit shaft was used by gnomes to travel up quickly.
	Aware of the dangers below, they trapped the ladder and hid the door at the top.

\end{exampletext}

If the players attempt to climb, they find that every rung of a multiple of five (the fifth, tenth, fifteenth, and so on), are coated in a slipper substance made from the fungal gardens.
The rungs which are a multiple of 7 are set to break once anything with a Weight Rating 7 or more will break the rung.%
\footnote{A creature's Weight Rating is equal to its HP.}

The nura have since abandoned this path, and are not aware of the door at the top.

\paragraph{If the players climb up the staircase without understanding the trap,}
have them roll Dexterity + Athletics, TN 10.
If they fall, they receive $1D6-2$ Damage.

If they continue climbing, give additional Dexterity rolls.
The character can then make an Intelligence + Tactics roll to understand the trap, TN 12.
Whatever number they roll, keep that result; it will tell you how long the character takes to figure out the trap.
Every time they make a new roll:

\begin{enumerate}

	\item{The Damage they get for failing increases by 1.}
	\item{The roll to understand the trap decreases by 1.}

\end{enumerate}

Of course, if the player figures out the trap, all rolls can be dispenses with, and the player can ascend to room at the top, on page \pageref{laddertop}.

\mapentry{Magic Portal}

\begin{boxtext}

	In this room there stands before you a Magical portal 8' high and 4' wide.
	A warm wind blows through the portal and there are runes above it.
	There are lit Sconces on the walls and the room seems empty accept for the scuff marks leading to and from the portal. 

\end{boxtext}

If any of the players are literate and speak the Gnomish tongue they can read the runes above the magical portal which read Desert Realm.

\mapentry{Spellcasters}

\begin{boxtext}

	Two goblins wearing long black robes bicker with each other.
	Another two stand at the side, apparently bored of the argument.

\end{boxtext}

\mapentry{Beds}

Plenty of goblins, just sleeping and playing games.

\goblin

\mapentry{Nursery}

\begin{exampletext}

	The gnomes locked this door tightly, while leaving enough food for their children to survive for days, then destroyed the key.
	Unfortunately, those gnomes have turned into goblins, and if they entered the room they would probably eat their own children.

\end{exampletext}

\begin{boxtext}

	The sound of crying emanates from the door as you swing it open.
	A dozen baby creatures with fat little noses lie in a crib with hay, looking up at you in terror.
	The entire crib and the floor around stink of shit.

\end{boxtext}

If the PCs enter the room, they may think these little gnomes are little goblins and kill them.
If any of them try to do so, have them roll a Wits + Medicine check to realize their mistake, TN 8.
Any gnomes in the party will automatically pass this check.

Jellies have taken over most of the area -- ogres simply grab what crawls out.
