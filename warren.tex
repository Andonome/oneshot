\section{The Lowest Level}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\setcounter{list}{0}

\mapentry{Rooms}

\begin{exampletext}

	Gnomes erected cots, cribs and hammocks here to be used as a communal sleeping area.
	Since then, goblins have placed a bar over the outside of the door to house prisoners.

\end{exampletext}

\begin{boxtext}

	You awake in darkness with ropes binding your hands behind your back.
	From the shifting and murmuring sounds around, you know others rest in the same room.

\end{boxtext}

Here the PCs awaken to their hopeless situation.
Have everyone roll Dexterity + Larceny against TN 11 to escape.
Run the first event in the time line -- \textit{the Escape} (page \pageref{escape}).

\paragraph{If the PCs make a lot of noise}
then the goblins down the hall are coming for them, and they had better move fast.
Make it clear the party have little chance of success in a head-to-head combat, so they should run the other way.

\paragraph{If the PCs exit quietly,}
they have free reign to explore.

\paragraph{If the party do not manage to escape}
then add 3 Fatigue Points for their time starving in prison, and throw in a load of new prisoners.

Once new prisoners are in, the players can spend Story Points to introduce old friends, and have \textit{them} roll to escape from bondage.

\mapentry{Exit Shaft}

\begin{exampletext}

	This exit shaft was used by gnomes to travel up quickly.
	Aware of the dangers below, they trapped the ladder and hid the door at the top.

\end{exampletext}

If the players attempt to climb, they find that every rung of a multiple of five (the fifth, tenth, fifteenth, and so on), are coated in a slipper substance made from the fungal gardens.
The rungs which are a multiple of 7 are set to break once anything with a Weight Rating 7 or more will break the rung.%
\footnote{A creature's Weight Rating is equal to its HP.}

The nura have since abandoned this path, and are not aware of the door at the top.

\paragraph{If the players climb up the staircase without understanding the trap,}
have them roll Dexterity + Athletics, TN 10.
If they fall, they receive $1D6-2$ Damage.

If they continue climbing, give additional Dexterity rolls.
The character can then make an Intelligence + Tactics roll to understand the trap, TN 12.
Whatever number they roll, keep that result; it will tell you how long the character takes to figure out the trap.
Every time they make a new roll:

\begin{enumerate}

	\item{The Damage they get for failing increases by 1.}
	\item{The roll to understand the trap decreases by 1.}

\end{enumerate}

Of course, if the player figures out the trap, all rolls can be dispenses with, and the player can ascend to room at the top, on page \pageref{laddertop}.

\mapentry{Magic Portal}

\begin{boxtext}

	In this room there stands before you a Magical portal 8' high and 4' wide.
	A warm wind blows through the portal and there are runes above it.
	There are lit Sconces on the walls and the room seems empty accept for the scuff marks leading to and from the portal. 

\end{boxtext}

If any of the players are literate and speak the Gnomish tongue they can read the runes above the magical portal which read Desert Realm.

\mapentry{Dining Room}

\begin{boxtext}

As you climb the stairs away from your cell you enter a room full of benches and tables overturned and broken. 
The floor is strewn with pots and plates, Knives,forks and candlesticks but no candles and not of scrap of food remains it looks like a pack of ravenous dogs swept through here and licked ever morsel from every surface.
In the middle of the room you can see upon a table 2 creatures one you now define as a goblin and the other you would call a rat but only if the rat had been mated with a Great Dane.
The two creatures seem to be fighting over something and as you focus on the scene before you it becomes clear that what they are fighting over is a bone (possibly human).
It looks at first like they are pulling at it one on each end but then you hear the sound of grinding and snapping and you realise that they are both biting into either end of this bone.

\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{If the players make a sound}
the goblin will stop fighting with the rat for the ownership of the bone and run out of the room shouting for the shaman who had left them in the cell previously.
There are 2 knives in this room that can be wielded as daggers 
Whatever happens, the rat will Swollow the reaining bone whole and attack.

\mapentry{Spellcasters}

\begin{boxtext}

	Two goblins wearing long black robes bicker with each other over a little table.
	Other goblins stand at the side, apparently bored of the argument.

\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{If the players try to sneak past,}
the roll is Dexterity + Stealth, TN 10.
They will also have to put out their torch, if they have one.

\paragraph{If the characters search the bodies,}
they find a Portal Scroll,%
\footnote{This scroll opens a portal to the Realm of Shifting corridors. See Adventures in Fenestra for more on it.}%
 and a Scroll of Uprising.

\magicitem{Scroll of Uprising}{Ghoul Calling}{Saurecanta}{Instant}{Pocket Spell}{+3}{7}

Once the spell is cast, all creatures with 11 HP or fewer in the surrounding 3 areas, raise from the dead.

\magicitem{Portal Scroll}{Unrestrained, Open Teleport}{Alchemy}{2 Scenes}{Pocket Spell}{4}{5}

The scroll takes 5 rounds to speak properly, and opens a doorway to the Realm of Shifting Corridors.%
\footnote{See Adventures in Fenestra for more on this realm.}
The portal remains open for 2 scenes.

\mapentry{Kitchen}

\begin{boxtext}
The door Creeks open and as you peer into the darkness you can just make out the 5 figuers sprawled over tables and chairs or curled up on the floor snooring quietly. 
From the embers of the hearth you can see the ovens and cooking utensils that make up a substansial Kitchen. 
Opening the door further the light from the hall way sconces fills the room you can see that the 5 figures are more goblins with little fat bellies.
At the end of the Kitchen you can see a large Door to a cold store with a lock on it and some large cleavers stuck into a butchers block 
\footnote a cold store is an old fasioned fridge
\end{boxtext}

In the room the players can find 2 cleavers which would be the equivilent to short swords and 2 large pot lids which could be used as bucklers
There is also a 6th goblin in the room hiddening the far corner in the dark players must make a preception roll of 8they can discover the 6th goblin.
Should they make to much noise or light up the room all goblins will wake up and attack.
The players can unlock the Cold Store with a dexterity + larceny roll of 10 to pick the lock and discover that the larder is still full of food.

\mapentry{The Dragon's Lair}

\dragon

\begin{enumerate}

	\item{He's annoyed about being woken up.}
	\item{He only speaks elvish.}
	\item{If he gets good intel, he can wipe the nura out in the lower levels.}

\end{enumerate}

\mapentry{Beds}

Plenty of goblins, just sleeping and playing games.

\goblin

\mapentry{Nursery}

\begin{exampletext}

	The gnomes locked this door tightly, while leaving enough food for their children to survive for days, then destroyed the key.
	Unfortunately, those gnomes have turned into goblins, and if they entered the room they would probably eat their own children.

\end{exampletext}

\begin{boxtext}

	The sound of crying emanates from the door as you swing it open.
	A dozen baby creatures with fat little noses lie in a crib with hay, looking up at you in terror.
	The entire crib and the floor around stink of shit.

\end{boxtext}

If the PCs enter the room, they may think these little gnomes are little goblins and kill them.
If any of them try to do so, have them roll a Wits + Medicine check to realize their mistake, TN 8.
Any gnomes in the party will automatically pass this check.
