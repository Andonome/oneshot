\newRule{Re-Rolls \& Group Rolls}{
  When players roll $2D6$ to perform an action, the dice tell you if the situation is favourable or not.
  Players do not re-roll dice unless the situation has changed.

  When a group of people want to do the same thing (sneaking, speaking, running), they don't all roll to check the situation -- only one player rolls dice, and all the players use the same result for their characters.

  \paragraph{Example 1:}
  the troupe are sneaking down a hallway, and have to roll Stealth + Dexterity (\gls{tn} 9).
  One player rolls $2D6$, and gets a `7'.
  Characters with a total bonus of +2 were walking quietly, but if even a single \gls{pc} had a bonus of +1 or less, they made a noise, and the entire group is given away.

  \paragraph{Example 2:}
  The characters try to persuade Chris to help them, and one player rolls the dice, getting a `7'.
  Their Charisma + Empathy total is -1, so they fail, but another character tries to speak with him and has a +3 total, so they succeed (without rolling the dice again).

  Gnomes erected cots, cribs and hammocks here to be used as a communal sleeping area.

Give the players a moment to get to know each others' characters and their surroundings.

a small voice from the corner of the room says
`\begin{textit} it's all useless, we're all going to eat each other\end{textit}'.
Chris was captured from a village along with another batch of prisoners.

\begin{exampletext}
  Blara the gnome accepted her fate, and her hunger, then began to learn nuramancy -- the sphere of magic which transforms gnomes into goblins and humans into ogres.

  Since then, she routinely enters the make-shift prison cell, and casts a spell on one of the prisoners to turn them into an ogre.
  The target of the spell becomes ravenous, and eventually eats another prisoner (they have no desire to eat other nura).

  She has made a dozen new ogres this way, but the last time one person was left on his own -- Chris.
  Since then, he has sat in the darkness, waiting to be eaten.
  Now the \glspl{pc} have been shunted into the cell with him, he knows his time is short.

Chris explains the situation to the \glspl{pc} (whether or not anyone asks him).

\paragraph{Trying to plea with Alf}
won't prove easy.
The player can attempt a Charisma + Empathy roll (\gls{tn} 12), to have him leave the room out of shame and guilt, but he won't help anyone.

\paragraph{If anyone asks Chris for help,}
he tells that that he already managed to wriggle out of the ropes binding him, but that it's all useless, because you can't fight against a monster.

Convincing Chris to help someone requires a Charisma + Empathy roll (\gls{tn} 9).

\paragraph{Shortly after,}
Blara the goblin nuramancer, and Alf (the last man to transform into an ogre) walk towards the cell.

\begin{boxtext}

  Heavy footsteps pad down the hall, you hear the door's bar being lifted, and a little goblinoid face peeps in with a torch.
  Behind her, an ogre stoops to the height of a man to avoid the low ceiling.

they can do so with a -4 penalty to the roll.

  Any characters with Mana Points (\glspl{mp}) regain 2 + their Wits Bonus.
}{}

\begin{exampletext}

  This exit shaft was used by gnomes to travel up quickly.
  Aware of the dangers below, they trapped the ladder and hid the door at the top.
  Since then, the goblins have forgotten how the ladder works, and stopped using it.

\end{exampletext}

If the players attempt to climb, they find that every rung of a multiple of five (the fifth, tenth, fifteenth, and so on), are coated in a slipper substance made from the fungal gardens.
The rungs which are a multiple of seven (seven, fourteen, twenty-one) are set to break once anyone with 7+ \glspl{hp} puts their weight on it.
These breakable sections are actually solid illusions, so they appear again shortly after breaking, but will resist any markings such as paint, as those marking disappear as the illusion resets every so often.
Meanwhile, any rung which is both a multiple of 5 and 7 indicates that the next section is entirely illusory -- the real ladder is on the left, but disguised as more wall with clever paint-work.

Despite the ladder switching places, it appears to be one solid piece, reaching upwards.

The nura have since abandoned this path, and have forgotten the door at the top.

\paragraph{If the players climb up the staircase without understanding the trap,}
have them make a Group roll of Dexterity + Athletics, \gls{tn} 10.%
If they fall, they receive $1D6-2$ Damage.

\paragraph{If they continue climbing,}
give additional Dexterity rolls and explain what happens, but only give out specific rung-numbers if the player asks.

\paragraph{If the players want to make a roll,}
character can then make an Intelligence + Academics check to understand the trap, \gls{tn} 12.
They cannot re-roll this result, but they can try to climb again, in which case:

\begin{itemize}

  \item
  The Damage they get for failing increases by 1.
  \item
  The \gls{tn} to understand the trap decreases by 1 (so they will succeed if they can endure long enough).

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{If a \emph{player} figures out the trap,}
all rolls can be dispensed with, and the \glspl{pc} can ascend to room \ref{laddertop} at the top.

\newRule{\Glsfmtlong{dr} \& Vitals Shots}{

  \Gls{dr} reduce Damage taken due to armour, or just a creature's thick hide.
  The nura rat has `{\scshape \gls{dr} 2}', so it removes 2 from any Damage Taken.

  We assume everyone is trying to target sensitive areas, like the throat, groin, and eyes, whenever they can, to hit more exposed areas.
  If anyone hits 5 points over what they need to hit the rat, they get a `\textit{Vitals Shot}', which ignores the \gls{dr} entirely, as the attack hits a sensitive area.
}

\mapentry[diningRoom]{Dining Room}

\begin{boxtext}

  As you climb the dark stairway, you see a tiny candle's light above, and hear shouting and thrashing.
  The floor at the top is strewn with pots and plates, knives, forks and candlesticks.
  It looks like a pack of ravenous dogs swept through here and licked ever morsel from every surface.

\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{If a \gls{pc} sneaks up quietly,}
have them roll Dexterity + Stealth, at a \gls{tn} of 7 plus the rat's Wits + Vigilance.

They should get a +2 bonus for leaving any lights behind.

\begin{boxtext}

  In the middle of the room you can see two creatures wrestling on a table -- a goblin and the other you would call a rat, but only if the rat had been mated with a Great Dane.
  The two creatures are fighting over a human leg.

\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} wait patiently and silently,}
the nura rat and goblin will leave.
The goblin will go up the lift, and the rat will wander the hall, searching for more food.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} make a sound},

\begin{itemize}

  \item
  the goblin grabs the candle on the table (which puts it out),
  \item
  then he runs out of the room, shouting for a nuramancer in room \ref{spellCasters}.
  \item

\end{itemize}

    The \textit{Damage Bonus} adds to their Damage.
    Anyone with +4 Damage replaces their Damage Bonus with a $D6$, so $1D6+4 = 2D6$ Damage, and $1D6+5 = 2D6+1$ Damage.
    \item
    The \textit{\glspl{ap} Cost} shows how many \glspl{ap} the character must spend to use the weapon (no matter who instigated the attack).
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
      Characters cannot declare actions when they have less than 1 \glspl{ap} left, but they can (and must) still spend \glspl{ap} to defend themselves.
      \item
      Characters can get pushed into negative \glspl{ap} when they are forced to Defend themselves, which then become a penalty (being on -2 \glspl{ap} means a -2 penalty to all actions).
    \end{itemize}
    \item
    The \textit{Weight Rating} tells you what level of Strength Bonus you need to use the weapon unencumbered.
    If a weapon's Weight Rating is higher than the character's Strength Bonus, then every additional point gives them -1 \glspl{ap} at the start of each combat round, and +1 Fatigue Points at the end of combat.

The gnomes created the lift with the Force sphere.
It can lift a combined Weight Rating of 16, and safely descend with a total Weight Rating of 26 standing on it.%
\footnote{A creature's Weight Rating is equal to its \glspl{hp}.
Some items count towards this total, but items with a negative Weight Rating do not.}

The lift responds to magical passwords -- the gnomish words for `farm' (for the top), `sleep' (for the middle), and `food' (for the bottom).
The various ogres and goblins who use the lift only know the passwords for the bottom and middle section.
Only the nuramancer goblins know the word for the top.

\mapentry[dragonApproach]{Dragon's Approach}

\begin{exampletext}

  Once the gnomes turned into nura, they neglected to de-activate the portal, as it's easier to see when it's open.
  A couple of hours ago, a dragon named `Makil' wandered in, and went up the stairs towards the treasure room, but could not fit through the little gnomish door.
  He managed to pull a chest full of copper coinage through the door, but could not get anything else as he could not reach.

  The Makil wanted to barter with the goblins, but found that they responded to him either by trying to fight him, or by running away, and none spoke elvish (the only language he knows spoken in these parts).

  The cautious beast won't approach the nura to attack when he has no idea how many there are around him.
  He may be powerful, but a room full of ogres alongside a spell caster could seriously injure or kill him, and he doesn't want to take the chance.
  Similarly, the nura don't want to take any chances, so they've decided to just leave him where he is.

  The nura and dragon have ended with a stalemate, so he has taken a nap.

\end{exampletext}

\begin{boxtext}

  Ahead, three charred goblin corpses lie on the ground.
  A strange scent wanders down from above, something like a chicken cooked in sulphur.

\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} loot the bodies}

Despite his linguistic deficits, he can communicate using the Enchantment sphere to send ideas to characters.

The dragon's eventual goal is to obtain the rest of the treasure, then return through the portal to the Realm of Bright Rocks.

\paragraph{If the party request he kill nura for them}
then he agrees to kill any in the current area, but will not journey to another floor.
In return, he wants all the treasure out of the treasure room.

\paragraph{If the party offer to split the treasure,}
he refuses, unless they give him a good reason.

\iftoggle{hardcore}{
  The treasure chinks noisily of course, so the party will then receive a -1 penalty to all Stealth checks.}{}

\paragraph{If the party push for more treasure,}
the dragon asks if they would like to challenge him to a game of riddles.
Each point anyone scores allows them to demand a single item, such as a chest, or quiver.

If they say `yes', then he accepts their challenge, and asks what their riddle is.%
\footnote{Use of the internet is prohibited by trans-dimensional law, common sense, basic decency, and the Geneva Convention.}
If they can think of none,
then the dragon declares that he has won the first round.

\paragraph{The rules for riddles}
are simple -- any question which someone has the knowledge to answer is a fair riddle.
Asking `how many letters in the Greek word for ``mushroom''?', is not a fair riddle, because someone may not know.

Any possible answer to a riddle is `the correct one'.
If someone asks `what is black and white and read all over', anything which fits all descriptions must be accepted as an answer.

See \autoref{riddles} for riddles.

\paragraph{If the players ask why he wants treasure,}
he explains that he wants to attract a mate; when his flame becomes hot enough to melt the gold, he will carve a golden statue of the most deadly dragon in his area in order to attract her attention.
He will then decorate the statue with magical items.
\footnote{Would you prefer a mate is beautiful, or one that can kill anything in an instant?
Dragons think the answer is obvious.}

\paragraph{If the dragon parts on good terms,}
he blesses them all with a \textit{Wide Blessing} (which heals $2D6$ \glspl{fp}), and casts a \textit{Fortune} spell on the weakest member, allowing them to receive +1 to their Combat Skill for

}{}

\newRule{Projectiles}{
  To use shortbows, crossbows, or just throwing a rock at someone, the player rolls $2D6$ plus their character's Dexterity + Projectiles.

  The basic \gls{tn} is 7, but can go up for targets who are farther away.

  If \glspl{npc} decide to \textit{Keep Edgy} (watching out for missile attacks), they can add their Speed + Vigilance to the \gls{tn}.
  This costs 1 \glspl{ap}, as they need to spend time looking around the room to see where archers (or spellcasters) are.

  So a goblin with Speed 2, Vigilance 1, would be \gls{tn} 7 to hit normally, but once they spend 1 \glspl{ap} to Keep Edgy, their \gls{tn} would be 10.

  \begin{itemize}

\magicitem{Scroll of Stone}{Fast Transmutation}{Alchemy}{1 Scene}{Pocket Spell}{6}{1}
One spoken, the scroll rolls $2D6+6$ at a \gls{tn} of 7 plus the target's Weight Rating.
If the spell succeeds, the target turns to stone.

This spell was designed to be used on the caster; the gnome would turn themself to stone in order to become uninteresting to oozes and such for a short while.
However, people can try to use it against other targets.

Like any other scroll, the activation word is a riddle.
Unlike some of the others, it works \emph{instantly}.

\magicitem{Lock Scroll}{Fast Lock}{Alchemy}{2 Scenes}{Pocket Spell}{4}{3}

This scroll locks a door, which increases the \gls{tn} to open it by 4.

  Around those pages, little grubs eat into the massive slugs.
  The moment you enter, their eye-stalks perk up, and they begin to slide off the corpses they were feasting on.
  To your left, stairs head upwards into darkness.

\end{boxtext}

\begin{exampletext}

Gnomes grew mushrooms throughout this room in order to grow slugs, so that they could feed fireflies.
While torches work best, having omnipresent fireflies around the warren makes sure that people can coordinate between rooms without worrying about light.

Since then, the nura turned those slugs into nura slugs.
The fireflies have survived on the enlarged slug, which the nura keep alive with the scraps they don't want to eat, such as mushrooms and bones and faeces.

  Below you, the entire floor is sticky and greasy.
  Somewhere close, you hear snoring.

\end{boxtext}

If the \glspl{pc} have indeed been quiet enough in the previous room to not raise an alarm, they find everyone in nearby rooms napping.
A single sound means they will be in serious trouble.

The greasy floor results from a mixture of faeces, drool, blood and leftover mushroom-juice.
Anyone who can use Conjuration magic will be able to turn the offal on the floor into a slippery substance.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} have come from room \ref{slugHall},}

  On one table, you can see a pile of weapons -- short swords and spears -- piled on a table.

  Frightened gnomes fled their bedrooms from the nura who had rushed through the portal.
  Most were caught, but some managed to run up the trapped ladders, having memorized the sequence perfectly.
  As the last one got to the top of the ladders, he turned to cast an illusion of a solid wall in order to fool anyone coming up behind him.

Picks, shovels, wood, short swords, shortbows, and all manner of crafting and mining equipment litter the room.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} have come up from room \ref{entrycell},}
they find the exit has been covered by an illusion of a wall.
If they investigate the area at all, the illusion fades, revealing the sleeping nura.

The gnomish word for `morning', activates the light, while the gnomish word for `night' stops it.
The nura do not know, or have forgotten, these activation words, so they simply keep it under blankets as they find the light irritating.

\paragraph{If anyone steps into the trap,}
they must roll their Weight Rating at \gls{tn} 15, but anyone failing may spend 5 \glspl{fp} to ignore the effects of the trap.
If this happens, explain that their foot or hand begins to harden, then turn to stone for half a second before they retract it.

\paragraph{If the players figure out that the area is trapped and try to jump over it,}
remind them that they cannot see where the trap starts and where it ends.
If they avoid stepping into the trap, they can make a Speed + Athletics roll, \gls{tn} 9, to jump over the afflicted area.

\mapentry[topShaft]{The Top of the Shaft}

\begin{boxtext}

  Ahead lies to massive double-doors.
  To the right, the hallway extends into a massive room, where you can hear the sound of sawing.

\end{boxtext}

Grank the nuramancer goblin has heard the \glspl{pc} coming, and has no intention of fighting them alone.
He knows he has the only key to the exit door, so he intends to loose the hell-hounds he has tied up at the room's side before fleeing into the fungal gardens.

\iftoggle{hardcore}{%
  By the time the party reach round the corner, he will have cut the ropes disappeared, leaving unchained nura wolves.
}{
  The party arrive to see him still sawing through the ropes, and have only a single round to stop him before he runs.
}

\paragraph{No matter what the party do,}
the wolves go straight for the kill.

\paragraph{If the party attempt to run through the double doors,}
they will suddenly find an empty lift-shaft, unless they have taken the lift to the top themselves.
Have them make a Wits + Athletics check (\gls{tn} 7) to back off before they fall.

\nurawolf[\npc{\A\N\T[4]}{4 Nura Wolves}]

\paragraph{If the party fall into the lift,}
they end up in the mid-section of the warren.

\mapentry[fungusGarden]{Fungal Gardens}

\begin{boxtext}

  As the doors open, your torchlight shows a crowded mess of fungus.
  Some reach up to your knees, others tower above the light and so far that you cannot see the top.
  The maze of unkempt mushrooms shows random, meandering paths between the taller fungi.

\end{boxtext}

\begin{exampletext}

  This beautiful fungal garden took dripping rain from above, and sieved it through the roof then the soil below, until it distributed nutrients for a forest of mushrooms, big and small.
  The fungal garden was regularly invaded by oozes which can creep into small cracks when young, and grow massive quickly.
  The nura never really kept up with the garden's maintenance, so the room festered with dangerous jellies.

\end{exampletext}

While the place looks serene, it is inhabited by
\iftoggle{hardcore}{%
  dangerous oozes.

}{%
  a dangerous ooze.
}

\paragraph{Once the players enter the room,}
\iftoggle{hardcore}{%
  the oozes begin to stalk them.
  If multiple oozes chase them, the smaller ones will always back away from the larger ones, so no more than one ooze should follow them at a time (always the largest one).
}{%
  the ooze begins to stalk them.
}

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} approach Grank,}
he will hide while casting a \textit{Wide, Fireball} (requires 2 rounds to cast, covers 4 steps, and deals $2D6+2$ Damage).
Finding him in the darkness before he finishes his spell requires a Wits + Vigilance roll, \gls{tn} 10.
If he is successful, the party make a group roll against \gls{tn} 9 to avoid the fireball ($1D6+3$ Damage).

\paragraph{If Grank ever feels like his life is under threat,}
then he will taunt the \glspl{pc} with the key to the outside world he has in is position, and throw it into the nearest ooze.
He then lets out a giggle and dashes off into the fungal undergrowth, leaving the players to face the hulking pulsating mass.

  The Seeing Stone is a simple stone with a hole.
  Staring into the hole allows one to watch the Realm of Bright Rocks.
  Particularly perceptive watchers will notice that those watching in the stone can see exactly the spot where the portal on the bottom level of the warren opens.

\mapentry[lockedDoor]{The Locked Door}

The locked door has a bronze border and cannot be broken without a Strength + Crafts roll, \gls{tn} 18.
The exit key, however, fits in nicely.

If the party rest here long enough (perhaps because they have failed to get any key), a raiding party of nura return.
See page \pageref{raidingParty} for the returning raiding party.

\mapentry[lowerExit]{The Exit}

\iftoggle{oneshot}{
  \begin{boxtext}

    As the key turns, the door swings open, and daylight floods in.
    Green trees cover the road down the hill, and in the far distance, chimney-fires from little hamlets wander into the sky.

    You have finally escaped from the warren.

  \end{boxtext}
}{
  This is where the party exit the lower portion of the warren, and enter the upper part.

  \paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} don't have a key,}
  they might try tricking the goblin on the other side, who has a key to let people in and out.
  See area 1, \autoref{upper}.

  \paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} examine the door,}
  they can see the goblin in the next area by a glimmer of candle-light.
