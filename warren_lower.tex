  \paragraph{Example 1:}
  The \glspl{pc} all try to get a feel for their surroundings in the darkness of room \vref{entrycell}.
  They make a \roll{Wits}{Caving} roll together.
  If the highest Bonus among the troupe is +3, the second-highest is +2 and the last is +1, then the total is ($3 + \frac{2}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = 5.25$)~`5'.
  So one player rolls the dice, and adds the troupe's +5 Bonus.

  \paragraph{Example 2:}
  The troupe want to search for the key in room \vref{slugHall} (\nameref{slugHall}) as quickly as they can.
  The \gls{gm} decides the roll should be \roll{Speed}{Vigilance}.
  Their Bonuses are +4, +3, +3, +1, +0, and -1.

  The later numbers can be ignored, so the troupe roll with a ($4 + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{4} = 5.8$) +6 Bonus.

  \begin{exampletext}

    Gnomes erected cots, cribs and hammocks here to be used as a communal sleeping area.
    Since then, goblins have placed a bar over the outside of the door to house prisoners.

  \paragraph{After a moment,}
  a small voice from the corner of the room says

  \begin{quotation}
    ``No use in struggling.
    They will eat us soon no matter what we do''.
  \end{quotation}

  \noindent
  The \glspl{ogre} captured \gls{sadMan} from a nearby village, along with others.
  They ate the others, while \gls{sadMan} hid under debris at the side of the room.
  He's learnt that cowardice means survival quickly, but won't unlearn it as fast.

  \paragraph{If anyone asks \gls{sadMan} for help,}
  he refuses, and explains why they are powerless, and may as well wait to be eaten.
  If they say they want to fight, he explains how large \glspl{ogre} stand, and how many wait above.
  If they say that he should untie them so they can die fighting, then he explains that he can't trust them, and that they might throw him out the door first.
  He would rather take his chances hiding in the dark.

  \paragraph{Every time the \glspl{pc} give \gls{sadMan} a reason to hope,}
  have them roll \roll{Charisma}{Empathy} at \iftoggle{oneshot}{\tn[9]}{\tn[11]}.
  Success means that \gls{sadMan} will untie them.
  A tie means he asks a follow-up question (allowing another re-roll if they can answer him well).
  A failure means he disengages, muttering ``no, it won't work''.

  \subsubsection*{Shortly after,}
  Blara the goblin druid, and an ogre walk towards the cell.
  The players should have around 5 actions (or dice-rolls) before trouble arrives.

  \begin{boxtext}
    Heavy footsteps pad down the hall, you hear the door's bar being lifted, and a little goblinoid face peeps in with a torch.
    Behind her, an ogre stoops to the height of a man to avoid the low ceiling.

  The ogre then tries to pick up a character, and take it up to the kitchen.

  they can do so with a -4 penalty to the roll.

\mapentry[escapeShaft]{The Chimney}

\begin{exampletext}
  The gnomes tunnelled down this shaft for mining, then made a ladder to easily reach the lower levels.

  More recently, the magical lift (room \ref{lift}) made it redundant, so they've placed a forge in front of the entrance to the workshop (room \ref{workshop}), since this shaft ascends above, as a chimney.
\end{exampletext}

\iftoggle{hardcore}{
  The players should make a \roll{Wits}{Crafts} (\tn[10]) to deduce that a furnace like this must have a wide chimney, and that tunnel may lead elsewhere.
}{
  The \glspl{pc} will probably encounter the ladder, carved into the stone, while feeling around in the dark.
  Perhaps one or more will find themselves at the top of the shaft when Blara enters.

  \paragraph{Anyone at the top of the ladder,}
  will hear an argument between a goblin and \pgls{ogre}.

  \paragraph{Pushing the furnace aside}
  demands a \roll{Strength}{Crafts} roll (\tn[6]), but doing so quietly requires a \roll{Strength}{Stealth} roll (\tn[13]).
  A tie means the horde stop bickering to focus on the noise, while failure indicates that they realize that the forge has a tunnel behind it, and two \glspl{ogre} come out to investigate (and likely try to eat a character).

  \paragraph{If someone wants to continue climbing up,}
  they can't.

\mapentry[lift]{The Gnomish Lift}

The gnomes created the lift with the Force Sphere.
It can lift a combined \gls{weight} of 17, and safely descend with a total \gls{weight} of 34 standing on it.%
\iftoggle{oneshot}{\footnote{A creature's \gls{weight} equals its \glspl{hp}, plus half the value of its equipment.}}{\footnote{For full details, see \autopageref{Lift}.}}
If the party step on it with a greater \gls{weight} than this, each additional point inflicts 2~\glspl{ep} on everyone in the lift upon impact with the ground.

The lift responds to magical passwords -- the gnomish words for `farm' (for the top), `work' (for the middle), and `cook' (for the bottom).
The \glspl{ogre} and goblins who use the lift only know the passwords for the bottom and middle sections (Blara extracted this information from a gnome before he died).%
\footnote{One goblin druid extracted the password for the top, but has kept this secret.}

The lift responds to any password spoken while standing on it.

\begin{boxtext}
  The great double doors swing open, revealing a wide, empty room.
  Your torchlight stretches far above, and well out of reach you can see a wooden ceiling.
  The room appears otherwise empty.

they will find less purchase than a Sun-screen salesman in a Scotland.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} dawdle too long here,}
a `raiding party' return with more prisoners to place in the lower cell (room \ref{entrycell}).
See \autopageref{raidingParty} for details on the raiding party.

\mapentry[dragonApproach]{Dragon's Approach}

\begin{exampletext}
  When the horde attacked, one gnome decided to activate \pgls{deep} scroll in order to flee.
  Like the others, it targeted an unknown area, full of powerful magic, deep underground.
  Unlike the others, it held a sleeping dragon, who woke, and sauntered through the magical gateway.
  He stomped on a couple of goblins, then followed the smell of gold and magic, to the treasure room.
  However, the massive monster could not fit through the door.

  When goblins came up the stairs to investigate, the dragon incinerated them with his fiery breath.
  So now he waits, with the legendary patience of a dragon.
  He has no intention of fighting, since he could get hurt, and the goblin horde have no intention of bothering him, so they just pass by that corridor.

  The dragon and the horde have ended in a kind of stalemate.
  And just like the horde, he cannot leave, as he does not know how to read the \Gls{deep} Scrolls\ldots
\end{exampletext}

\begin{boxtext}
  The stairs go up then turn right and up again.
  A single hand stretches from the midway-point's shadows, open to the ceiling.
  A strange scent wanders down from above, something like a chicken cooked in rotten eggs.

\mapentry[dragon]{The Dragon's Lair}

The dragon will happily talk with anyone who approaches%
\iftoggle{hardcore}{, although he only speaks Gnollish and Elvish.}{
  The dragon's eventual goal is to obtain the rest of the treasure, then leave the \gls{warren}, and go somewhere he can spread his wings.
  Like all dragons, he has more cunning than ferocity, and \emph{plenty} of both.
  He will look for opportunities to turn the \glspl{pc} against each other, and reframe all conversations around the assumption that he will soon leave, with most of the treasure, through \pgls{deep} scroll, and that the \glspl{pc} should view this as their best possible outcome.

  Despite his cunning, he will agree to worse terms if he has to.
}

If the \glspl{pc} have no light, but still ascend, \gls{warrenDragon} will stay silent and still, then attack.
A sneak-attack from a dragon generally means death.

\paragraph{Revealing \pgls{deep} scroll}
gains no reaction.
\Gls{warrenDragon} knows he has to play it cool, and not let anyone know that he really needs that spell to leave this place.
He \emph{might} fit through the narrow passages up, but he would be in a dangerous situation, being cramped in a narrow corridor, with \glspl{ogre} everywhere.

\paragraph{If the party request he kill goblins for them}
then he agrees to kill any in the current area, but will not journey to another floor.
In return, he wants all the treasure out of the treasure room.

\paragraph{If the party offer to split the treasure,}
he refuses, unless they give him a good reason.

\iftoggle{hardcore}{
  The treasure chinks noisily of course, so the party will then receive a -1 penalty to all Stealth checks while carrying it.}{}

\paragraph{If the party push for more treasure,}
the dragon asks if they would like to challenge him to a game of riddles.
Each point anyone scores allows them to demand a single item, such as a chest, or quiver.

If they say `yes', then he accepts their challenge, and asks what their riddle is.%
\footnote{Use of the internet is prohibited by trans-dimensional law, common sense, basic decency, and the Geneva Convention.}
If they can think of none,
then the dragon declares that he has won the first round (`best of three!').

\paragraph{The rules for riddles}
are simple -- any question which someone has the knowledge to answer is a fair riddle.
Asking `how many letters in the Greek word for ``mushroom''?', is not a fair riddle, because someone may not know.

Any possible answer to a riddle is `the correct one'.
If someone asks `what is black and white and read all over', anything which fits all descriptions must be accepted as an answer.

See \autoref{riddles} for riddles.

\paragraph{If the players ask why he wants treasure,}
he explains that he wants to attract a mate; when his flame becomes hot enough to melt the gold, he will carve a golden statue of the most deadly dragon in his area in order to attract her attention.
He will then decorate the statue with magical items.%
\footnote{Should the ideal mate be pretty, or have the power and aggression to destroy an entire town?
Dragons think the answer is obvious.}
